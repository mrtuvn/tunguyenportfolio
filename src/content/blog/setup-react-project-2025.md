</div>

### What is the Folder Structure React?

### Steps

Most projects start with a template. Let's use a basic template maintained by React Router:

```shellscript nonumber
npx create-react-router@latest my-react-router-app
```

Now change into the new directory and start the app

```shellscript nonumber
cd my-react-router-app
npm i
npm run dev
```

You can now open your browser to `http://localhost:5173`

### Conclusion

This is one of the most used architecture. As I have already mentioned, no one best architecture will suit evert project. So we ourselves will decide parts into our project and always remember to maintain a folder structure so every project is simple and easily understood by any developer.
